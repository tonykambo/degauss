#Building an Apollo DSKY mock device

The **Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC)** **Display and Keyboard (DKSY)** mock device will only simulate a few key scenarios from Apollo 11 and Apollo 13. The hardware will comprise a 3D printed shell with a built in ESP32 driving the keypad and LEDs. It will be powered by a rechargable LiPo battery.
