My Estes model rocket launch controller is no longer functioning. Time to build my own. 

The following circuit provides three switches:
- Power - switches the power on.
- Arm - Readies the circuit for launch.
- Launch - ignites the starter.

I set up a simple circuit with one push button to test igniting the starter with a single 9V battery.
